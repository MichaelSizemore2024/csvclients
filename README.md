# CSVClients

## Description

These two clients are sample clients that demonstrate the full functionality of the server for the Alpha. 
The email client was developed in conjunction early on but has since been abandoned due to these clients being ultimately replaced, so only the education client will run. 

## Environment Setup

- [ ] Clone into seperate repository to run individually or in the 'Clients' folder within db-manager
- [ ] Run Makefile

# Running the CSV Clients
$ python education_client.py <csv_file_path> --address <server_address> --port <port_number> <arg>
    # i.e for python client
    $ python3 edu_client.py data/education_data.csv

## Project status

Developed for University of Utah Spring 2024.
